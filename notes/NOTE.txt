i am making a chat app with websockets in go. I am confused on implementing group DMs. Like how can I handle when a user sends a message to a specific group, only the specific group members will receive the message? For online users that are connected to my ws server (ws stands for websocket), they will instantly receive the message via the websocket, and that message is also saved in a chat postgres DB, where offline users can later load those new messages when they open the app. Now how can I save the ws connection (conn) of each user, keep track of it and they receive that message when another member of the group they are in messages that group or room or private DM
